## üöÄ Introduction

Every year, I watch the 24 Hours of Le Mans with great attention.<br><br>
The 24 Hours of Le Mans is an endurance race held every June. As the name suggests, it‚Äôs a 24-hour race where the participating cars must not only be faster than their competitors but also reliable enough to finish the race.<br><br>
In 2023, many prestigious brands participated, creating a legendary race. It was also the 100th anniversary of the event.<br><br>
All of these reasons led me to work with a dataset related to this edition and then to look further and work with a dataset encompassing all endurance races from 2012 to 2023 to predict Toyota's results in each of these races.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technos Used

- **Python**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Pandas**
- **Plotly**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**

## üîë Projects 

1. **Data Visualisation**
- A performance analysis of the 2023 edition of the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
- A performance tracking of the top 5 to understand the criteria that allowed them to finish in these positions.
- A comparison between the performances of the top 5 cars and the two Peugeot cars, in order to identify areas for improvement.

2. **Supervised Learning**
- Dataset Pre-Processing
- Feature Engineering: Adding new features derived from research on the characteristics of each race and each participating car.
- Supervised Learning: Dimensionality reduction of the training data, training multiple models, and evaluating their performance.
