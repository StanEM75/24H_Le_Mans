## üöÄ Introduction

This project focuses on data pre-processing related to the 24 Hours of Le Mans 2023 dataset. Once the data has been processed, the goal will be to identify initial trends during the EDA, and then to focus on the leading cars. We want to understand if it's possible, based on this dataset, to determine which factors contributed to the winners securing the race. Finally, we will perform a detailed analysis of Peugeot's performance compared to that of the top 5.
